  Ubuntu machine executor with native Docker support. Uses a machine executor
  (not Docker) because buildx requires direct Docker daemon access for QEMU
  emulation and multi-platform builds. Ubuntu 24.04 provides a current Docker
  engine and buildx plugin out of the box.

  resource_class:
    type: string
